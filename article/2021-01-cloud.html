              <div class="chapter" name="Intro">Earning GCP Associate Cloud Engineer completes my journey of getting to know the basics for all 3 major Cloud providers.</div>
              <div class="chapter" name="AWS">AWS offers native some of the best quality video trainings with aws.training with some great, easy to understand examples. Here I wanted to give special thanks to Stéphane Maarek for his excellent and most importantly extensive Udemy course.</div>
              <div class="chapter" name="Azure">Azure offers great documentation with some of the exercises even enabling trainees to use cloud sandboxes to have some hands-on experience. Not to mention their free Foundational vouchers after completing Azure Virtual Training Days and more advanced ones after completing Microsoft Ignite Cloud Skills Challenge, which I'm planning to use in the nearby future.</div>
              <div class="chapter" name="GCP">Last, but not least, GCP. There aren't many materials for it, but I was able to get some hands-on experience with qwiklabs' Google Cloud Skills Challenge and during these 30 days I learned more than I could ask for and it would be great to see similar materials in the AWS and Azure offering. There are AWS Jams and sandboxes in some of the Azure trainings, but those are not even close to qwiklabs. It was only thanks to that and help of Ranga Karanam's course that I passed it.</div>
