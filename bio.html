              <h1>Studies</h1> In 2015 joined Warsaw University of Technology on Bachelor programme with Automatic Control and Robotics major. Over the years learned OOP languages as well as more low-level oriented technologies like PLC, SCADA and microcontroller programming. <br> As a thesis project worked on an analysis of 6-DOF manipulator structure by simulating various tasks with different wrist build configurations. Project was received positively receiving "very good" reviews with final grade "above good" in 2020. <br>
              <br> Immediately after getting BScEng degree followed the studies by joining Master programme with the same major. Continuing studying different predictive regulator algorithms and system modelling as well as designing more advanced, scattered and composite systems. <br> For masters' project, system for smartphone owner authentication authentication was created in order to analyse different types of identification and anomaly detection using behavioral data during handheld usage. Such technology could be used as a second security layer on top of typical biometrics and/or PIN layers. <br> The thesis was received with "very good" grade following by the same final mark, completing Master of Science in Engineering degree. <br>
              <br> Currently working on writing an article based on master thesis research and pursuing MBA degree.

              <h1>Professional career</h1> In 2017 did summer internship in Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (Russia) during the promotional edition of Team for the Future of NICA project - first 3 month edition. <br> During this internship worked on integrating cooling control into RACK system with National Instruments' CompactRIO environment as well as external security access card system using Telnet protocol. Results were presented after the internship on NICA Days event in Warsaw. <br>

              <br>
              <br> About a year later joined Deloitte's Digital Banking Solutions (previously known as Core Banking Transformation) data migration team. Worked there as an intern for a Canadian bank for about half a year and successfully finished Phase 1 of of the project by migrating lending products. <br> After promotion to Consultant and since Phase 2 was not meant to start immediately, I was moved to two other migration projects. One in Hungary and the other in Slovakia. Worked there as a technology support consultant, migration tool configuration developer and analyst as well as a solution architect for new functionalities of internally developed migration tool. <br> Taught several other people to support the projects and then left the Hungarian project to focus on the Slovakian one and take over the Phase 2 project in Canada. <br>
              <br> After successfully finishing migration of customer data in Slovakian project (scope of more than a million customers) to Temenos T24 R20 core system and after moving on from the analysis of Canadian Phase 2 project joined System Engineering Team as a Senior Specialist. There worked on proof-of-concept software for data scrambling and anonymization, another project for integrating multiple core banking systems out-of-the-box and performed multiple migration demos for potential clients.
