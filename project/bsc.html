          <strong>Abstract.</strong> The purpose of this thesis was to verify if currently used wrist geometry in service robot Velma is the best solution and, if not, to find configuration that provides better results in selected tasks. In order to do this there was a need to create simulation environment and work out rules and criteria for quality evaluation. Tests were performed in ROS environment while Gazebo simulator was responsible for physics calculations. <br>
          <strong>Architecture.</strong> Velma testing system contains two components. ROS environment built upon velma_sim_gazebo and automation scripts allowing for continuous testing. <br>
